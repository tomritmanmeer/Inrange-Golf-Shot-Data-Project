# Inrange-Golf-Shot-Data-Project
Analysis of my own golf shot data from the Inrange radar technology at Tonbridge Golf Centre 

I hit a number of golf shots on the practice range at Tonbridge Golf Centre with each of my driver, 3 wood, 4 iron, 7 iron and 56 degree sand wedge. The Inrange technology tracks a range of variables by radar and stores them on a database, allowing the data for each session to be downloaded in .csv format. In this project I have imported this data using Pandas, cleaned and processed it into a useable form and then carried out some visualisation and analysis using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, to see where potential improvements may be achieved.

Club details:

Driver - Titleist TS3 - 10.5 degree loft

3 Wood - Titleist TS3 - 16.5 degree

4 Iron - Taylormade P770

7 Iron - Taylormade P770

SW - 56 degree Callaway MD5 wedge
